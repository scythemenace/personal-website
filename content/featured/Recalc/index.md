Recalc is a web app designed to help users enhance their math skills through a comprehensive platform. It includes features such as a fun mini-game, an exam tool with progress tracking, and study resources available in four different languages.

My team and I developed this project as part of our coursework, which focused on teaching design thinking and agile methodologies. We built the web app using ELM in a custom IDE.
