A real-time web application supporting multi-user interaction in a 2D virtual environment with synchronized movements and peer-to-peer voice chat. Me and my team built this for HackWestern '24 and wanted something similar to gather.town or the metaverse.

Although we successfully implemented the multiplayer functionality, we encountered challenges in getting the voice chat to work. Nevertheless, this project was one of the most significant learning experiences for me, as it involved taking on such a substantial task and completing it within just two days.
