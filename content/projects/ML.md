This repository contains all the notes that I took while taking Andrew Ng's Machine Learning course on Coursera. These notes are based on my personal understanding and interpretations of the course material. Writing them helped me reinforce and solidify the concepts taught in the lectures, making it easier to grasp the key ideas.
