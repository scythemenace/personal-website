This features well-commented code examples that quickly refresh core concepts of C++ without the slow pace of traditional courses. This stemmed from my frustration with forgetting certain intricacies of a programming language after not using it for a while and not wanting to rewatch videos or relearn from tutorials. Since I had written all the code myself, I commented it thoroughly to ensure I could quickly refresh my understanding of all the concepts when needed.
